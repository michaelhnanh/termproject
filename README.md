# 15-112 Term Project [Austin's Adventure]
ahuynh - class of 2028

[Description]
Austin’s Adventure is a game that puts you into the shoes of the titular Austin Schick after a tiring Fall semester of teaching 15-112, reminding Professor Kosbie about important dates, and getting TAs in line. He’s decided to take a well-earned trip to Verbier Switzerland to enjoy some nice leisure time in the clear, open slopes of the snowy wilderness. Why skiing? The snow reminds him of light mode VSCode and the CMU CS Sandbox (he’s working on disconnecting fully from work).

Austin's Adventure is an infinite skiing game that allows for relaxation while enjoying music, sounds, and satisfying physics.

# [Run Instructions]
The cmu_graphics package from CMU should be installed and placed into the '\Modules' directory.
To run the game, the 'Main.py' file should be run.
