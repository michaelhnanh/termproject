# code for alternative terrain that isn't the ground 
# i.e. hot air balloons, streamers, and other structures

# streamers have to follow their own logic as they hang and also follow the balloons, so including them in
# the same file seems poignant. streamers droop down from balloon to balloon,
# thus the big question is if the player character should stay glued to them or should he fly off?
# 

# structures i.e. ruins would add more flair to the terrain, and would probably be generated 
# in much the same way as the terrain, since they still should obey by the consistent curvature
